# rbxts-transformer-template
This is a simple template framework that simplifies creating transformers.
It allows you to transform code in stages, as well as communicate to past and future stages.

This was designed specifically for Roblox-TS, but should work on normal transformers.

Example stages/util are built into the template, however they may be moved into a seperate examples directory eventually.
